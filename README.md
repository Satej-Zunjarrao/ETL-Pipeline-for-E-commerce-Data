# ETL Pipeline for E-commerce Data  
A modular pipeline to extract, transform, and load e-commerce transactional data for real-time reporting and analytics.

---

## Overview  
The **ETL Pipeline for E-commerce Data** is a Python-based system designed to process and centralize transactional data from multiple sources. By integrating various technologies and cloud platforms, the pipeline enables businesses to analyze key metrics such as revenue, profitability, and customer behavior efficiently. It also supports real-time reporting for dynamic dashboards.

This project features a professional and scalable architecture, ensuring adaptability for future business requirements.

## Key Features  
- **Data Extraction**: Connects to databases, APIs, and flat files to fetch raw data.  
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans, standardizes, and enriches data with calculated fields such as revenue per transaction and profit margin.  
- **Data Loading**: Centralizes transformed data into a Snowflake data warehouse, optimized with partitioning and indexing.  
- **Real-Time Workflows**: Implements real-time data ingestion and transformation using AWS Glue.  
- **Visualization**: Prepares data for tools like Tableau and Power BI to enable insightful reporting.  
- **Scalability**: Supports integration with additional data sources, ensuring flexibility for evolving needs.

## Modules

### 1. **data_extraction.py**
- Connects to SQL databases, APIs, and flat files to extract raw data.
- Consolidates data into a single CSV file for further processing.

### 2. **data_transformation.py**
- Cleans data by handling missing values, duplicates, and type inconsistencies.
- Enriches data with calculated fields such as revenue per transaction and profit margin.

### 3. **data_loading.py**
- Loads the transformed data into a Snowflake data warehouse.
- Implements partitioning and indexing strategies to optimize query performance.

### 4. **real_time_workflows.py**
- Uses AWS Glue to perform real-time or near real-time data ingestion and transformation.
- Supports automation for dynamic updates to dashboards.

### 5. **visualization_setup.py**
- Fetches data from the Snowflake data warehouse for reporting purposes.
- Prepares data exports compatible with Tableau and Power BI.

### 6. **config.py**
- Centralized configuration for database credentials, API keys, file paths, and logging settings.

### 7. **utils.py**
- Provides reusable functions for logging, execution time measurement, and DataFrame validation.

### 8. **main.py**
- Orchestrates the ETL pipeline by integrating all modules.
- Logs pipeline execution and monitors progress across each stage.
